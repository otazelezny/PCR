## Introduction
This project is open to the community and aims to provide an affordable and flexible PCR thermocycler. The system is designed to be customizable for various experimental needs. We are aiming for intuitive control's and choice to source and build your own thermocycler by your self. For start just with pc terminal. Future plans are that the thermocycler could by controled via web ui and can be chained together with other devices.

## Features
- 3d printable model for easier production 
- customizable software for thermocycler control
- Easily configurable through an configuration file
- fast thermal cycles
- temerature curve control 

## 3D Model
The 3D model of the thermocycler is available in the `3d-model/` directory. This model is designed for standard FDM 3D printers. For detailed information on how to print and assemble the device, refer to the [Assembly Guide](3d-model/AssemblyGuide.md).

## Software
The software is designed to control the thermal cycle and manage the hardware. The source code is available in the `src/` directory. The software is written in Python and supports the following features:
- Setting temperature profiles
- Monitoring current temperature
- Automatic temperature regulation

### Basic Commands:

            "not complete yet"

## Configuration File

The configuration file config.json allows customization of temperature profiles and other device parameters. For more information on how to configure the system, see the Configuration Guide.

## Installation

For detailed information on how to install both hardware and software, please refer to the Installation Guide.

## Usage

This thermocycler can be used for various experimental purposes. More detailed usage instructions can be found in the Usage Guide.

## Contributing

This project welcomes contributions from the community. If you would like to contribute to the development, please refer to CONTRIBUTING.md for guidelines on how to get started.
